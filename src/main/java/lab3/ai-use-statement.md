How to use switch in java

Great — let's get into how the `switch` statement works in Java!
But first: What’s your level with Java? Have you used `if` statements before?

---

Assuming you're familiar with `if`/`else`, we can build from that:

### 💡 What's a `switch`?

A `switch` lets you run different blocks of code based on the value of a single variable — usually cleaner than a long chain of `if`/`else if`.

---

### Basic Format:

```java
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // code block
        break;
    case value2:
        // code block
        break;
    default:
        // code if none match
}
```

---

### 🔍 Checkpoint:

Let’s walk through a tiny example together.

What do you think this code would print?

```java
int day = 2;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        System.out.println("Wednesday");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Another day");
}
```

Try to answer before I say anything. What line will it print?



What is override

Nice — great topic to explore! Java’s **`@Override`** is all about making sure you’re **replacing behavior** from a parent class or interface.

Let’s slow it down:

---

### 💭 First: What do you already know about **classes** and **inheritance** in Java?

Just so I don’t explain too much or too little:

* Have you used **`extends`** in a class before?
* Or made a **subclass** that inherits methods from a parent class?

---

If not, I’ll explain with a simple example. But assuming you know the basics of inheritance:

---

### 🧠 What does `@Override` mean?

It tells Java:

> “Hey, I’m **intentionally replacing** a method from the parent class.”

This is used when a **child class wants to change the behavior** of a method it inherited.

---

### 🔧 Example:

```java
class Animal {
    void speak() {
        System.out.println("The animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void speak() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks");
    }
}
```

Now when you do:

```java
Dog myDog = new Dog();
myDog.speak();
```

👉 It prints: `The dog barks`

Even though `Animal` had a `speak()` method — `Dog` **overrides** it.

---

### ✅ Why use `@Override`?

* It **helps catch mistakes**.
  If you accidentally type the method name wrong or use the wrong parameters, Java will **give an error** instead of silently ignoring it.

---

### Quick Quiz:

Ready? What do you think this prints?

```java
class Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle starting...");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starting...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle myVehicle = new Car();
        myVehicle.start();
    }
}
```

➡️ What line will it print? Try to figure it out before I say anything.

How to use override
💡 What is @Override?

It means:
"I’m changing the behavior of a method from the parent class."

You use it when a child class wants to do something differently than the parent class.

✅ Simple Example:
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark!");
    }
}


Now if you write:

Dog d = new Dog();
d.sound();


👉 It prints: Bark!
Because the Dog class overrides the sound() method.

🔍 So, in simple words:

The parent class gives a method.

The child class uses @Override to change it.


Explain toString

What is toString() in Java?

It’s a method that tells Java:

“When someone prints this object, here’s what to show as text.”

By default, Java shows a weird code like:

MyObject@6d06d69c


But if you override toString(), you can control what gets printed.

✅ Example (Without toString()):
class Car {
    int speed = 100;
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car();
        System.out.println(myCar);
    }
}


Output:

Car@1b6d3586


👎 Not helpful, right?

✅ Now with toString():
class Car {
    int speed = 100;

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Car speed: " + speed + " km/h";
    }
}


Now if you run:

Car myCar = new Car();
System.out.println(myCar);


You get:

Car speed: 100 km/h


🎉 Much better! You told Java how to describe your object.

🔁 So in simple words:

toString() is used to print object info nicely.

You override it in your class.

Java uses it when you do System.out.println(object).

How to create error message

📌 Quick check:

Are you asking how to:

Show an error message to the user? (like: System.out.println("Error: Invalid input!"))

Throw an error (exception) in your code? (like: throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid value"))

Catch and handle errors with try and catch?

👉 Which one do you want to learn first?

If you’re not sure, just tell me what kind of “error” you want to make — like when something goes wrong in a program.

Explain try and catch

💡 What are try and catch?

They help your program handle errors (called exceptions) without crashing.

try block: You put code here that might cause an error.

catch block: You write code here to handle that error if it happens.

Imagine this:

You’re trying to open a door (try), but sometimes the door is locked (error).
If it’s locked, instead of getting stuck, you have a plan (catch) — maybe try a different door or call for help.

Simple Example:
try {
    int result = 10 / 0;  // This will cause an error (division by zero)
    System.out.println(result);
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Oops! You can’t divide by zero.");
}

What happens?

The try block runs.

When it hits 10 / 0, Java throws an error (ArithmeticException).

The program jumps to the catch block.

The message "Oops! You can’t divide by zero." is printed.

Program continues without crashing!

catch throw example

🔍 Quick definitions first:

throw — you use it when you create an error and send (throw) it.

catch — you use it to catch and handle that error when it happens.

Example with both:
public class Main {
    // A method that throws an error if input is negative
    static void checkNumber(int number) throws IllegalArgumentException {
        if (number < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Number must be non-negative!");
        }
        System.out.println("Number is: " + number);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            checkNumber(-5);  // This will throw an error
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

Step-by-step:

Inside checkNumber(), if number is less than 0, we throw a new error (IllegalArgumentException).

In main(), we try to run checkNumber(-5).

Since it throws, the program jumps to the catch block.

The catch prints:
Caught error: Number must be non-negative!

Why use this?

You throw errors when something goes wrong inside your methods.

You catch errors where you want to handle them safely.


different types of exceptions?

What are exceptions?

They’re errors that happen while your program is running — like trying to open a file that doesn’t exist, or dividing by zero.

Java divides exceptions mainly into two types:
1. Checked Exceptions

The compiler forces you to handle them (with try/catch or by declaring with throws).

Usually happen outside your control, like file I/O or network errors.

Example:

IOException (problem reading/writing files)

SQLException (database errors)

2. Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions)

You don’t have to declare or catch them, but you can.

Usually caused by programming mistakes.

Example:

NullPointerException (using a null object)

ArithmeticException (like dividing by zero)

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException (accessing invalid array index)

Bonus:

Errors (like OutOfMemoryError) are serious problems you usually don’t catch—they indicate JVM issues, not normal program errors.


Assign enum and array

1. Enum assignment
What’s an enum?

It’s a way to create a group of named constants — like days of the week or colors.

How to define and assign:
enum Color {
    RED, GREEN, BLUE;
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Color myColor = Color.GREEN;  // Assigning an enum value
        System.out.println(myColor);  // Prints: GREEN
    }
}

2. Array assignment
How to create and assign values to an array:
int[] numbers = new int[3];  // Create an array of size 3

numbers[0] = 10;  // Assign value 10 to index 0
numbers[1] = 20;
numbers[2] = 30;

System.out.println(numbers[1]);  // Prints: 20


Or assign directly when creating:

int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30};

Quick check:

What value is stored in numbers[2] in the last example?

How would you assign Color.BLUE to a variable?



Explain StringBuilder

What is StringBuilder?

It’s a special class to create and modify strings efficiently.

Unlike regular String, which is immutable (can’t be changed), StringBuilder lets you change the text without making a new object every time.

Why is this important?

Every time you change a regular String, Java creates a new string behind the scenes — which can be slow if you do lots of changes (like inside loops).

StringBuilder avoids that by modifying the same object.

Basic usage:
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");

sb.append(" World");   // Adds " World" to the end
System.out.println(sb.toString());  // Prints: Hello World

sb.insert(5, ",");     // Inserts a comma at index 5
System.out.println(sb.toString());  // Prints: Hello, World

Quick summary:
String	StringBuilder
Immutable (can't change content)	Mutable (can change content)
Slower for many changes	Faster for lots of changes
Quick question:

If you need to add text many times inside a loop, would you choose String or StringBuilder? Why?

How to use this.row and this.column 

Do you have a class with fields named row and column? For example:

class Move {
    int row;
    int column;

    Move(int row, int column) {
        this.row = row;
        this.column = column;
    }
}

So, what does this.row mean?

this.row refers to the field (variable) row inside the current object.

row without this refers to the parameter or local variable named row.

Using this.row = row; assigns the parameter value row to the field row of the object.

Why use this?

When the parameter name and field name are the same, this helps avoid confusion and tells Java which one you mean.

Example explained:
class Move {
    int row;    // field
    int column; // field

    Move(int row, int column) {  
        this.row = row;          // Assign parameter 'row' to field 'row'
        this.column = column;    // Assign parameter 'column' to field 'column'
    }
}

Quick question for you:

If you wrote row = row; without this, what do you think would happen? Would the field get assigned?

Explain Getter method

What is a getter method?

It’s a method that lets you read (get) the value of a private variable from outside the class.

Why use getters?

Usually, you make variables private to protect them.

Then you use getters to allow safe access to their values.

Basic format:
class Person {
    private String name;

    // Getter method for 'name'
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

How to use it:
Person p = new Person();
// suppose you set p.name inside the class somehow
String personName = p.getName();  // Get the name using getter
System.out.println(personName);



how to use getter method


Step 1: You need a class with a private variable and a getter.

For example:

class Car {
    private String model;          // private variable

    // Constructor to set the model
    public Car(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }

    // Getter method to access 'model'
    public String getModel() {
        return model;
    }
}

Step 2: Create an object and use the getter to read the value
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Toyota");      // Create a Car object with model "Toyota"
        String carModel = myCar.getModel(); // Use getter to get the model
        System.out.println(carModel);       // Prints: Toyota
    }
}

So, in simple words:

The variable model is private (hidden).

The method getModel() lets you read the value from outside the class.

You call the getter like objectName.getModel().


example of getter method


Here’s a simple example of a getter method in Java:

class Student {
    private String name;  // private variable

    // Constructor to set the name
    public Student(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getter method to access the private variable 'name'
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student("Alice");    // Create a Student object
        System.out.println(s.getName());     // Use getter to print: Alice
    }
}

What’s happening here?

The variable name is private (can’t access it directly).

The method getName() returns the value of name.

We call s.getName() to get the student’s name.


What is java.util.scanner


What is java.util.Scanner?

It’s a Java class used to read input from the user (like typing on the keyboard) or from files and other sources.

Where does it come from?

It’s part of the java.util package.

So you import it at the top of your program with:

import java.util.Scanner;

What can it do?

Read numbers (nextInt(), nextDouble(), etc.)

Read words (next())

Read lines of text (nextLine())

Simple example:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);  // Create Scanner object to read input

        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();          // Read a full line of text

        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
}


when to use java.util.scanner

Use Scanner when you want to:

Read user input from the keyboard (console).

Read data from files or other input sources (like strings).

Quickly and easily get numbers, words, or whole lines from input.

Examples of when to use it:

Asking a user to enter their name, age, or choices.

Reading commands or options in a console program.

Reading data from a file line-by-line or token-by-token.

When NOT to use Scanner:

For complex file parsing or very large files (better to use other classes like BufferedReader).

When you need very fast input (Scanner is convenient but not the fastest).

For GUIs or web apps — Scanner is mainly for console apps.


Operations available to use with scanner

Let’s look at the common operations (methods) you can use with Scanner to read input.

Common Scanner methods:
Method	What it does	Example usage
nextInt()	Reads an integer	int x = scanner.nextInt();
nextDouble()	Reads a double/decimal number	double d = scanner.nextDouble();
next()	Reads the next word (token)	String word = scanner.next();
nextLine()	Reads a whole line of text	String line = scanner.nextLine();
nextBoolean()	Reads a boolean (true/false)	boolean b = scanner.nextBoolean();
hasNext()	Checks if there is another token	while(scanner.hasNext()) { ... }
hasNextInt()	Checks if the next token is an integer	if(scanner.hasNextInt()) { ... }
Quick examples:
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
int age = scanner.nextInt();

scanner.nextLine();  // Consume the leftover newline

System.out.print("Enter your full name: ");
String name = scanner.nextLine();

System.out.println("Hello " + name + ", age " + age);

Important tip:

After reading a number with nextInt() or nextDouble(), use scanner.nextLine() to consume the leftover newline before reading a line of text.


When to use console.displayMessage and system.out.println

Both console.displayMessage and System.out.println can be used to show messages, but they’re quite different. Let me break it down:

1. System.out.println

It’s the standard Java way to print text to the console (command line).

Works everywhere in Java programs.

Example:

System.out.println("Hello, world!");


Use it when you want to quickly print something during development, debugging, or in simple console apps.

2. console.displayMessage

This is not a standard Java method.

Usually comes from a custom class named Console (or similar) that someone wrote.

It might do extra things like:

Format messages nicely,

Log messages,

Show messages in a GUI,

Or control output in some way.

You only use this if your project includes such a console object.

Summary:
Use System.out.println when:	Use console.displayMessage when:
You want to print simple text to the console	You have a custom console class that manages output
You’re writing a basic Java program	You need formatted, controlled, or GUI-based messages


My pom.xml is empty. i can't compile my main.java

Are you using Maven to build your Java project? Because pom.xml is the Maven configuration file.

Why is pom.xml important?

It tells Maven how to build your project, what dependencies to include, Java version, and more.

If it’s empty, Maven doesn’t know what to do, so compilation will fail.

Let’s fix it step-by-step.
Basic pom.xml template for a simple Java project:
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 
    https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>com.example</groupId>           <!-- Your package/group name -->
    <artifactId>myproject</artifactId>       <!-- Your project name -->
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

    <properties>
        <maven.compiler.source>17</maven.compiler.source>  <!-- Java version -->
        <maven.compiler.target>17</maven.compiler.target>
    </properties>

    <dependencies>
        <!-- Add dependencies here if needed -->
    </dependencies>

</project>

Steps to fix:

Copy-paste this template into your empty pom.xml.

Change groupId, artifactId, and Java version to match your project.

Save the file.

Run Maven compile commands, like:

mvn clean compile


Maven should now compile your Main.java (assuming your code is in the right folder).
