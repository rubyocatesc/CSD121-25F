I am getting an error when generating JavaDoc

When I write test, how can I know if I must use assertEquals or if I must use assertTrue

What is the purpose of assertThrows?

When to use assertThrows and illegalArgumentException

Do I need to use @Test for each test?

Do I have to have a different package for the test?
